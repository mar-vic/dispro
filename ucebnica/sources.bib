It has been "brewing" for a long time, with many hours, months, years of research talking to people, gathering their ideas, listening to their frustrations, applauding their successes. Only Steve with his experience, credentials, wit, and enthusiasm for the subject could have written this book. But it is also a measure of the success and maturity of ISO 8879 and its amazing longevity that allows an "SGMLer" to write such a book. We can now laugh at ourselves, even disclose our mistakes without fear of the other guy. While most would not recognize it, the revolution known as the World Wide Web would not have happened without a non-proprietary, easy, and almost "portable way to create and distribute documents across a widely disparate set of computers, networks, even countries. HTML, an SGML application, enabled this and as a result the world and the SGML community will never be the same. For some the term SGML means order, management, standards, discipline; to others, the term brings images of pain, confusion, complexity, and pitfalls. To all who have engaged in it, the Standard means hard work, good friends, savings in terms of time, money, and effort, a sense of accomplishment and best of all - fun. This book adds immeasurably to all of these. Enjoy the quote from Through Looking by Lewis Carroll as much as we have.},

	abstract = {Git () is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.
Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows — thousands of parallel branches running on different computers. 
As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities. Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repositories on remote machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy. 
Git is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.
Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel. The trademark "Git" is registered by the Software Freedom Conservancy, marking its official recognition and continued evolution in the open-source community. 
Today, Git is the de facto standard version control system. It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95\% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022. It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.},
